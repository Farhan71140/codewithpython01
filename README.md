❓ What is Client-Server Architecture in Python?

Client-server architecture in Python is a network design model where two separate entities—client and server—communicate with each other to perform tasks. The server provides services or resources, and the client requests them.


❓ How does the server work in this architecture?

The server is a program that waits for incoming connections. It listens on a specific port and responds to requests from clients. It can handle multiple clients and perform tasks like sending data, storing information, or processing commands.


❓ What role does the client play?

The client initiates communication by connecting to the server. It sends requests (like asking for data or submitting information) and waits for the server’s response. Clients can be anything from web browsers to custom Python applications.


❓ What kind of communication happens between client and server?

They typically communicate over a network using protocols like TCP/IP or UDP. TCP is more reliable and commonly used for applications that require guaranteed delivery, such as file transfers or messaging systems.

- Chat applications
- Multiplayer games
- APIs and microservices
- Remote data access systems
- 

❓ Can Python handle multiple clients at once?

Yes, Python can handle multiple clients using techniques like threading, multiprocessing, or asynchronous programming with libraries such as asyncio. This allows the server to manage many simultaneous connections efficiently.

❓ What is REST architecture?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on stateless communication and uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources.


❓ How is REST used in Python?

In Python, REST architecture is commonly implemented using web frameworks such as Flask, Django, or FastAPI. These frameworks allow developers to build APIs that follow REST principles, enabling clients to interact with server-side resources over HTTP.


❓ What are the key principles of REST?

In Python, REST architecture is commonly implemented using web frameworks such as Flask, Django, or FastAPI. These frameworks allow developers to build APIs that follow REST principles, enabling clients to interact with server-side resources over HTTP.

❓ What are the key principles of REST?
- Statelessness: Each request from the client contains all the information needed; the server does not store session data.
- Resource-based: Everything is treated as a resource, identified by a URL.
- Uniform interface: Standard HTTP methods are used consistently.
- Client-server separation: The client and server operate independently.
- Cacheability: Responses can be cached to improve performance.
- 

❓ What are common HTTP methods used in REST APIs?


❓ What are common HTTP methods used in REST APIs?
- GET: Retrieve data from the server
- POST: Send new data to the server
- PUT: Update existing data
- DELETE: Remove data

❓ Where is REST architecture used in Python applications?
REST is widely used in:
- Web and mobile app backends
- Microservices
- IoT systems
- Data-driven dashboards
- Any system that needs structured communication between client and server

❓ Why is REST popular in Python development?
REST is simple, scalable, and works seamlessly with Python’s lightweight frameworks. It allows developers to build robust APIs quickly and integrate them with frontend applications, third-party services, or other systems.
