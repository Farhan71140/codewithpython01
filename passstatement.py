# Define a function that does nothing (for now)
def my_function():
    pass  # Placeholder for future code

# Using pass in a loop
for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        pass  # Skip doing anything when i is 1
    else:
        print("Processing number:", i)

        #Absolutely! The pass statement in Python is used as a placeholder. It tells Python:
# “Don’t do anything here… for now.”
#- You might be planning to write code later.
#You need to avoid errors when a block of code is required but you don’t want to write anything yet.
#- In the function my_function(), pass avoids an error even though the function is empty.
# In the loop, when i == 1, Python just skips that part silently.
